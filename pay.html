  <h2>Designing resilient payment infrastructure for the UK government</h2>
<br><br>

<p>GOV.UK Pay is a secure, scalable payments platform for government services. It provides the public with a simple way to pay online, supported by enterprise-grade infrastructure.</p>

<p>The platform integrates with multiple payment service providers (PSPs) through a consistent API for transactions, refunds, chargebacks and status updates. It is designed to meet national-scale requirements, including PCI DSS compliance, high availability, and accessibility by default. It also includes tools for monitoring, reporting and reconciliation.</p>

<p>Today, GOV.UK Pay supports thousands of live services across central and local government. As of 2024, it has handled over 200 million payments and is used by millions of people across the UK every year.</p>

<h4>My role</h4>
<p>I led design for GOV.UK Pay for 18 months, most of that during the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of this work focused on critical, strategic initiatives that required design to scale across systems and teams. It was a hands-on, end-to-end role covering service, product and interaction design. I worked closely with lead and senior colleagues in engineering, policy and operations to align direction and unblock delivery. I also provided strategic leadership across the roadmap, platform resilience, spending reviews and cross-government design standards.</p>

<h4>Key initiatives and impact</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Improved admin navigation, reducing task time by around 20 seconds per session</li>
  <li>Redesigned transaction search, helping Companies House detect organised fraud and save millions</li>
  <li>Introduced self-service sandbox testing, cutting support tickets by 76% and enabling growth to over 750 live services</li>
  <li>Designed regulatory KYC flows that avoided disruption for 300+ organisations</li>
  <li>Enabled services to switch PSPs in ~20 minutes (down from 6+ months)</li>
  <li>Simplified fraud prevention to remove barriers such as reCAPTCHA</li>
  <li>Produced accessible, plain-English contracts to support platform adoption</li>
  <li>Led discovery into recurring payments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Switching payment providers</h3>
<p>One of the most technically complex and strategically important initiatives was proving GOV.UK Pay’s core promise: that services can switch PSPs easily.</p>

<h5>The challenge</h5>
<p>A key promise of GOV.UK Pay is that services can switch payment providers easily, without getting locked into long contracts or complex integrations. Until the pandemic, that promise had never been fully tested.</p>

<p>That changed during COVID-19. Over 250 organisations, including the Foreign Office running 79 emergency travel services, needed to switch providers urgently. The risks were high: disruption to critical services, overwhelmed support teams, and reputational damage to the platform.</p>

<h5>My approach</h5>
<p>I started by mapping the switching journey end-to-end. This included identifying gaps in user experience, technical dependencies, and operational handovers.</p>

<p>We uncovered several risks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Duplicate accounts for live services</li>
  <li>Manual support processes increasing the chance of human error</li>
  <li>Complex configurations across departments, especially during out-of-hours changes</li>
</ul>

<p>We mapped different behavioural profiles across teams — Drivers, Gatekeepers, Evangelists, and those who Keep Things Running. Drivers were most affected, as they were responsible for integration, testing and continuity.</p>

<p>We ran targeted research and engagement sessions with these users to understand their workflows, pain points, and risks. The concerns were clear:</p>


As one service user told us:
“It would be terrifying if we had to go through each service one by one with multiple providers.”

A support colleague put it bluntly:
“How does the support team handle the bazillion emails and services?”
This research helped ground the work in real operational needs, not just technical design patterns.



<blockquote>“It would be terrifying if we had to go through each service one by one with multiple providers.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“How does the support team handle the bazillion emails and services?”</blockquote>

<p>These insights grounded our understanding. But we also had to tackle the technical and systemic complexity. We facilitated workshops with infrastructure teams, support colleagues, and policy leads to map the system end-to-end, surfacing hidden constraints, technical debt, and operational bottlenecks.</p>

<p>We quickly learned that bulk switching — moving multiple services at once — was not viable. Each service had unique business processes, governance approvals, technical dependencies, and operational nuances.</p>

<p>The initial product instinct was to minimise changes due to resource constraints. But it became clear that wouldn’t work.</p>

<p>If we couldn’t simplify the system itself, we had to simplify the process for users, even if that meant doing the hard work behind the scenes.</p>


<h5>Designing for operational realities</h5>
<p>This work focused on improving the process of switching PSPs in a way that was simple for users, but resilient behind the scenes. The journey involved multiple systems, handovers between teams, and operational dependencies. I started by understanding where the process began and identifying the points where users got stuck.</p>

<h5>Starting from the first touchpoint: the inbox</h5>
<p>The switching journey usually began with an automated email about contract expiry. But these emails weren’t always reliable. Admin inboxes were often unmonitored, and team members frequently changed roles.</p>

<p>To improve this, I looked at where users were already active in the system. These were often operational or casework staff. Designing prompts at these touchpoints made switching more reliable.</p>

<p>By combining email with in-product messaging, I created a more dependable way to notify users and prompt action.</p>

<h5>Prompting action at the right time</h5>
<p>Initial designs used full-page interruptions. But behaviour data showed many users bypassed dashboards entirely and bookmarked specific views.</p>

<p>I introduced persistent banner components across key screens. These prompts were non-blocking and linked directly to the switching task list. They were visible without interrupting users’ day-to-day tasks, and they tested well with operational staff.</p>

<h5>Keeping transaction history clear</h5>
<p>Users needed access to both old and new provider transactions, especially during reconciliation.</p>

<p>I kept provider data clearly separated in the interface and signposted the current provider’s status at relevant points. This preserved existing bookmarks and reduced confusion during the transition.</p>

<h5>Creating a dedicated switching space</h5>
<p>I designed a separate section in settings for PSP switching. This reduced risk by keeping switching separate from the live provider configuration.</p>

<p>I also introduced a task list model. Early versions asked users to manually mark steps complete. Based on testing, I worked with engineers to automate this — marking tasks as done when API checks passed (for example, after a successful test payment).</p>

<h5>Working across systems and teams</h5>
<p>I collaborated with engineers to integrate APIs from providers like Worldpay and Stripe. I also wrote technical documentation to support credential handovers and reduce onboarding delays.</p>

<p>Where possible, we automated checks and reused data to reduce the burden on internal teams. Design decisions were shaped by how the system was actually used in production, not assumptions.</p>

<h4>The outcome</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Reduced switching time from 6+ months to around 20 minutes</li>
  <li>Enabled 87% of organisations to switch without disruption</li>
  <li>Significantly reduced support tickets and manual interventions</li>
  <li>Received positive feedback from users and service teams</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reflections</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Start with real user needs, not assumptions</li>
  <li>Design across services, systems, and operations</li>
  <li>Do the hard work behind the scenes to make things simple</li>
  <li>Tackle design debt early to avoid systemic risks</li>
  <li>Collaborate deeply, but lead with clarity when needed</li>
</ul>

<p>GOV.UK Pay shows that government platforms can meet enterprise-grade demands while remaining accessible, resilient and user-centred.</p>

<p>As Principal Designer, I combined hands-on design with strategic leadership to help make that possible.</p>
