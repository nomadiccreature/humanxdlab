<br>
I first came across the term User Experience in 2011 while working on a large transformational design project for ABB in Finland. <br> <br>Over the years, UX as a discipline has evolved from Norman's principles to policy changes that had transformed services; to ordinary labelling fixes that impacted millions. This has also transformed my understanding about UX.
<br> <br>
Today, I see UX as an ever-evolving system of coherent intentions that touches people's lives in many tangible and intangible ways to provide at least a satisficing influence.
<br> <br>
<!-- Since, then I've learned, practised, taught, eliminated and reused many ways to approach building an experience.  -->
And after tweaking, failing, experimenting and going through many learnings I settled in these following principles that I use to approach any design work.
<br> <br>
<i><span style="font-weight:700;">User-Centered // Data-Driven // Agile // Inclusive // Empathy // Organic </i></span>

                    </i>
                </p>
                <!-- What is UX for me? User experience design is about designing a coherent flow of user intention that facilitates the highest degree of satisfaction with least resistance to the process. The improvement of the performance of this flow is an iterative learning process based on data-driven from the user’s needs, user’s action, the tools where the action is performed and the context.

                <p>
                    While no two design challenges are the same nor approaching it in the same way would provide us the best results. However, there is an underlying structure that I follow to keep me focused, resilient, creative and humble.

                    <br>
                    <br> It’s based on my own academic and professional experience, working and learning from design thoughtleaders such as Yuvvone Rogers, Don Norman, Jacob Nilsen, Kristina Höök, Ben Shneiderman etc.. The main highlights are drawn upon from concepts such as JTBD (Job To Be Done), lean and agile methodologies, asking the right questions, identifying user pain points and contextual investigation.
                    <br>
                    <br> Although the nature of the design process is presented in a sequential manner, it is iterative and there is a level of flexibility to align the process based on the suitability of the project.
                    <!--     While it is not a strict rule nor every project is not big enough to encompass the over-arching UX design process but I do follow it closely. -->

                <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Understanding the context (intend)</i></span>
                </p>
                <p> I begin by gaining insights of the business vision, goal and objectives of the brand. I use a variant of the lean canvas to gather the key information including the problem/challenge and customer segment (user). </p>
                <img src="./assets/process-mts.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

                </p>

                <p>
                    I use a petal diagram or a 2X2 Matrix to identify the direct and indirect competitions. This provides us insights on where the brand sits, customers reaction to them, preparation for customer interaction and potentially this kind of comparative analysis provides innovative ideas during the ideation stage.</p>
                <br>
                <br>

                </p>
                <p>

                    The above steps provides us with hypothesis to be tested and helps us define the intial success metrics. This ensures all stakeholders are aligned with key aims and expectations before moving into the design stage.</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally before moving to the research phase, it is important that I am made aware of any deadlines, upcoming launch, any communication protocols with stakeholders, organisational structure etc.

                <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Any previous research</i></span>
                </p>
                <p> I try to find out if there is any previous (formative/summative) research work being conducted (market/user research, competitor analyses, etc.) and analytics data (incase of an existing product) as this would help in adding to the hypothesis.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Initial research will help to test the assumptions. Interacting with users gives me insights on their day to day life, their needs and pain points. I do this by running qualitative studies such as interviews, ethnographic studies, observations, survey, guerilla testing etc.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Expert evaluation/Content Audit</i></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Incase a proof of concept/MVP/Product is already being built, I would run expert evaluation technqiues such as cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, tree testing, content audits to create awareness of the designs, content consistency and flow.</p>

                    The research provides solutions to the hypothesis. Such as if we are targeting the right user. User persona and empathy map are created based on the profiles identified creating user empathy.

                <p>By the process of diverging and converging we explore, develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem, regardless of feasibility.
                    <br>
                    <br>Inspired by Google design sprints and lean startup, I run series of collaborative workshops that involves How Might We questions and brainstorming solutions. Affinity diagram is used as the common analysing technique and open critique sessions are used to prioritise and resolve conflicting design ideas.

                </p>
                <p> The outcomes from the workshop are captured and translated into low fidelity prototype(s) that can be tested with users for feedback. I do this by early sketches, sitemaps, mockups, user flow and other visuals, moving into creating wireframes to set the overall direction and description for the prototype and feedbacks.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Information architecture</i></span>
                    <br> Once the wireframe had few rounds of feedback I go through the content and make sure it aligns with the brand, tone of voice and familiar & consistent to the user. Card sorting is a common technqiue I use to create a coherent labelling.

                    <br> Designing effective interface needs strong foundations and guidelines. After going through platform specific guidelines, I map out the foundational interface guidelines, workflow, pattern library etc. to establish the design system. This continues to designing the hi-fi interface and interactions.</p>

                <br>

                    <br> I conduct user testing such as scenario based participatory evaluation with target personas to capture behaviours and not opinions. This is achieved by involving the team in outlining an analysis matrix with specific assumptions/outcomes that are tested and rated with severity points for further improvement.

                    Once the design is live, continuous feedback is recorded and measured by statistical analysis of data as well as involving the customer support team for qualitative data.</p>

                <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Improving on design</i></span>
                   As the design evolves and matures, I use techniques such as A/B testing, Multivariate testing to make decisions.</p>

The design process I follow has six (6) phases, following is quick summary:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>GATHER: Gathering requriments</li>
<li>RESEARCH: Exploring user needs and pain-points</li>
<li>ANALYSE: Establishing empathy and extracting key evidence</li>
<li>IDEATE, DESIGN & ITERATE: Refining solution, creating meaningful design and information flow</li>
<li>TRANSFORM & TEST: High-fidelity Designs/Interaction Design and evaluation</li>
<li>MEASURE & MATURE: Review metrics and track usage to mature design</li>
</ul>

To re-iterate the above design process is an outline that do not cover all the novel UX techniques/methodologies. I adapt to each design challenge and context using the above process.


                <!--   <h1>Research</h1>
                <p> Research is a significant part of designing any kind of services and product. At various stage of the design cycle, I use different techniques. With any good research it is important to lay out the hypothesis, set research questions, understand the participants, recruit the right participants, have a suitable sample size, use the appropriate data collection techniques as well as data analysis.</p>
