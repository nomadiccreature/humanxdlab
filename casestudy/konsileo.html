                <p>

The first business insurance policy was written in the 17th Century in Lloyd’s Coffee House in London. After hundreds of years, brokers still rely heavily on huge paper files, processes that are archaic with many workarounds in place, and old legacy systems which cause huge inefficiencies resulting in brokers spending roughly 60% of their time on dull administrative and operational tasks.
 <br>

<!--                 <br>
While large businesses have their own risk advisory departments, small and medium businesses (clients) depends on insurance brokers, who advise them with business risk and necessary insurances. With new challenges for brokers such as cyber risks, terrorism etc. the paper files are ever increasing.
 <br> -->
                <br>
There are companies that tried to ‘improve’ insurance broker’s process or move them to a ‘better’ IT system, but all these projects had all resulted in adding yet more admin and paperwork to their already endless list of tasks. One of the most popular software used by broker today is OpenGI (see picture).
 <br>
                <br>
<!-- Due to strong regulatory requirements by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) it often becomes more challenging to built better solution without proper compliance. In addition, changing the way an entire industry has operated for hundreds of years requires changing people’s habits, their ways of thinking and the process they’ve become so familiar with during their career. -->

                <h6>CHALLENGE</h6>



<!--  Konsileo was founded by industry veterans and engineers, who were frustrated with the current ways of doing things. At that time, Konsileo had already acquired one of the largest insurance brokerage firms to pilot Konsileo’s platform. The firm had 200+ insurance brokers and placing premiums of up to £90 million. -->

 <i>In this case study, I will describe my design process building a Fact Find that became the foundation of other value-added services that Konsileo would provide to disrupt the insurance broking Industry.  </i>

                 <br> <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                    Fact find is the most repetitive and time consuming operational tasks, that every broker would do as the first step in knowing about a business client.

                <br><br>It is a form filling session where an insurance broker would visit clients premises to understand about the business and gather the essential information in multiple complex paper forms (55+ pages).
                <br><br>
                The goal was to create a seamless experience of the fact-finding process that would reduce redundancy and the loss of information.

                <h6>REQUIREMENT GATHERING</h6>

                <p>
                Coming from a non-insurance background, I quickly acquainting myself with the insurance industry. I had initial requirement gathering sessions with the CEO, business analyst and product manager where I got to know the vision behind the business, challenges we are trying to solve, team aspirations and setting initial roadmap.
               <!--  , it was time to know the users. I used several user research methodologies to explore the breadth and depth of users (insurance brokers) behaviours and challenges. -->
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                <h6>DESIGN RESEARCH</h6>
                <p>I used focus group with the brokers to open up a healthy conversation regarding big and small operational issues faced during their daily work. I asked them to start sticking the issues up on a whiteboard and discussed each one in turn.
                    <br>
                <br>
                Once they had a good talk about their frustrations, I presented the tagline “If you had a magic wand ..."  and asked them what insurance broking would look like in the ideal world. We labelled these ideas “Opportunities” in the affinity map.
<br><br>
 <img src="./assets/kon-research.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
  <br> <br>

<p>
    Then I wanted to get to the heart of some of the issues raised so to better understand the end-to-end process and find out inefficiencies I asked the brokers to help me with a task analysis. Again, this was insightful and it was interesting to see how differently all of them completed the same processes, using different ‘workarounds’ to overcome inefficient and inadequate IT systems.

                <br>

<h6>ANALYSE</h6>

Throughout the focus group and tasks analysis processes, I encouraged my whole team to participate to develop empathy towards the users and understand the operational tasks. (show picture).
<br><br>

The Affinity map aided us to showcase trends, themes, concerns and areas of opportunity for discovery and improvement.

                    “When I visit a client for Fact finding I need to carry around 20 different paper forms because each type of insurance (e.g. professional indemnity, cyber liability) is captured on a separate form.”
<br>
                <br>
“The forms are very rigid and sometimes I need to capture information that is not asked for (or there is no space for) on the form.”

                <h6>EMPATHY</h6>

                 <p> Triangulating between research on existing tools, interviews, observations and user data provided greater validation and insights. Given the time period, I was quite satisfied with my research findings to move forward in the next phase. <br><br> Using the information from the task analysis I created four personas and sketched storyboards of their typical work-day and mapped out their user journeys. This was presented back to my team visually to enable them to clearly identify and agree on pain-points and areas for significant improvement.</p> <br><br>

                <h6>IDEATE & PROTOTYPING</h6>
                  <p>
It was important that the brokers feel part of the solution, so I invited them for a design studio workshops. The goal of the workshop was to explore a wide set of ideas and also create a shared vision to move forward within a short amount of time.

<!--  <br> <br>
I did a small presentation on my research findings and briefed about the user journey. As well as showed them on how to draw simple pictures with pens and paper. -->
<!-- <i>  To set the scene, I introduced them to a persona, a scenario and a task I wanted to solve for them. I started with the question of what could replace paper during a fact finding session?
<br>
Persona: A Senior Account Manager<br>
Scenario: At an on-site visit with a client discussing their insurance requirements<br>
Tasks: Need to capture five complex information about different insurance needs, quickly, in front of the client. <br>
</i> -->

<br>


                <p>
               During the sessions, individually and then collaboratively the team ideated and started sketching their ideas.
 <br> <br>
To make the session interactive and soak them fully into the design, I introduced them to Wizard of Oz and Role-playing. I choose Wizard of Oz methodology as this would give the participant full-freedom of interacting with different kind of props and the observers a good understanding of what would be the best option for the devices we could choose. Each one of them would role-play their sketched ideas to replicate a real scenario.

                <h6>DESIGN & ITERATE</h6>
                <p>The session was recorded and then we sat down to discuss and compare how those significant pain points were handled by the brokers using props and which screen size they were more comfortable with.
<br><br>
By the end of the session, we all agreed to go with a modular desktop interface as majority of them prefered a relatively medium-sized screen (bigger in size than a tablet) with keyboard, touchscreen and camera facilities which would be portable as well as would be easy to connect to their large sized monitors once they were in office. Additionally, we had produced a couple of sketches and a high-level user flow which everyone supported. The sketch also included ideas to connect various data feeds, such as Google maps, Companies house company data.
<br><br>
<!-- It was a strategic design that would not just make the process quicker but more intuitive and broker would happily switch to ripe the benefit of automatic data feed.  -->
