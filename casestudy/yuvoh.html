                <h6>PROBLEM</h6>
                <br>
                <h3> The property investment market is broken.</h3> <br><p class="text-white">Traditional companies such as Rightmove and Zoopla are focused on residential property while do not fully cater to buy-to-let (BTL).
                <br>
                <br>
                With the inception of companies like AirBNB, the market has seen unprecedented growth and shift towards short-term BTL over long-term BTL due to higher rental yields. This has created new opportunity as well as uncertainty.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                   <h3>  There is no easy way to understand the valuation and rental yield of a property. Investors depend on property brokers, subscribe to market trends, some guestimates and some do detailed analysis using traditional time-consuming methods in excel.</h3> 
                    <br>
                    These techniques are risky, unreliable, expensive, in-efficient, stressful and often ends up in bad deals.

                <h6>AIM</h6>
                <p>An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was built that gained popularity among property investors (a network of early adopters) due to its yield estimation engine but it had challenges around user experience, engagement and product-market fit. While MVP proofed that the model works, it failed to engage users due to lack of User experience.
                <br>
                <br> 
                The goal was to design a consistent and coherent experience for the users while increasing their engagement.

                <h6>REQUIREMENT GATHERING</h6>

                <p>
                I began the project by running stakeholder workshops to understand their requirements and familiarise myself. This helped me in developing insights on the business, roadmap, constraints and technical feasibility and get an entire picture of the user and the vision the team had for the platform. I used a modified version of the business model canvas.
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                Further, I teamed up with the product manager to map out the key stages in the customer journey and how the business currently addressed those needs for the customers. This provided a set of hypotheses to test and some ideas to explore by directly interacting with the customer.

                <h6>DESIGN RESEARCH</h6>
                <p>I conducted expert customer interviews, evaluation of the existing MVP and competitor analysis to drive our design research phase.

                    <br> 
                    The interview was focused on their approach, experience and pain-points. Interviews were done over Google Hangout.

                    The research phase gave us insights about how people would discuss investment with their close network over social media, they would attend property education and networking events and the majority of them are subscribed to property alerts.

                    <br> 
                    We noticed that guaranteed yield and short-term BTL were preferred over long-term BTL. Further, the evaluation provided insights on the existing platform’s content structure, core features and user journeys. We drew on these insights through the design process.

                    <br>
                    This helped us to create empathy and find commonalities. We referred to them throughout the entire product development process.

                    From our research, we were able to work out what matters to its customers and how to visualise those insights in a way that customers can understand. It would also help the customers make informed decisions and build trust in the site.

                    They didn't care about viewing the house per se nor care about the location, they cared more about the point of interest around the location was an important early factor. So we mapped out all the different PoIs and how that could be integrated into the platform. These kinds of insights occurred throughout our design research process and fed into our visual design direction for each product line.

                    <br> We used the process map to translate the journey map into wireframes. It also helped us to highlight any redundancies in the current workflow and target opportunities for improvement. It also helped us define key success metrics and build a funnel to measure success and analyse expectations.</p>

                <p>We tried out a range of ideas as lo-fi sketches and then developed them into mid-fi wireframes in Invision Freehand. Sketching wireframes allowed us to quickly test and iterate design solutions.

                    <br>
                    <br>The early test helped us identify features that would help customers understand their choices and make more informed, confident purchase decisions.
                    <br>
                    <br> User insight helped set the design direction quickly and show this in a Proof of Concept. This meant that before significant investment in development we could check and improve our thinking with feedback from business stakeholders and target customers.</p>

 <br>
                <p>We quickly moved into the product design phase. I worked with Yuvoh design team in a series of 2-week sprints to define the key features of the new platform.</p>

                    <br> Once the site was live and analytics was in place, we analysed HotJar session recordings to monitor user interaction over time and guide us towards the next feature design.
                    <br>
                    <br>The property list page, which our earlier research, as well as the recordings indicated as a "hole" in the journey, was confirmed by doing further user testing.
                    <br>
                    <br> We found out that the user was confused and clicking elsewhere once they reach the property list page.
                    <br>
                    <br> We compared research notes, journeys and tested wireframes to design it. They were looking for the about page and how it works. So it gave us an idea of what would be the next design.

                        <br> It was rapidly revealed that more than 75% of people were viewing the site on a mobile device and most of the traffic would come from Google search looking for a property in a specific location. So to further optimize the site we decided to use <a href="https://amp.dev/" target="_blank"> AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) </a>.
                        <br>
                        <br> AMP would load web pages in less than one second and use 10 times fewer data than regular web pages.

                        <br>
                        <br> I insisted to spend time with the sales and customer service team to go through call logs and email conversation.
                        <br>
                        <br>By taking part in a few live calls, “fly on the wall”, I found that the term "rental" attracted a lot of non-user to come to the site looking for renting a property. Since then we have replaced the word "rental" from phrases such as rental yield, to short-term/long-term let yield. </p>

For example in the following figure below, visitors of option B got easily qualified to the next step in the funnel than option A. </p>

            <p>To maintain consistency and ensure efficient design to dev handover, I developed a modular design system based on reusable components and their states, such as cards, list items, and controls. Every component can be rearranged and combined with others while maintaining design consistency and recognizable UI patterns for the user.</p>
