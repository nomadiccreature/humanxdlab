    <h1>GOV.UK One Login Design System Foundations</h1>
    <p>Laying the groundwork for consistency, alignment and scale across a complex, fast-paced government service.</p>
  </header>

  <section class="overview">
    <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduced a design system approach for GOV.UK One Login, spanning web, mobile and in-person journeys</li>
      <li>Built an interactive prototype — now critical for onboarding, training and service readiness</li>
      <li>Strengthened Figma, mobile design patterns and frontend alignment</li>
      <li>Surfaced hidden design and product debt, making gaps visible and manageable</li>
      <li>Helped teams align and deliver consistently — without slowing delivery</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="challenge">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>GOV.UK One Login helps people prove their identity and access services across web, mobile and in-person journeys.</p>
    <p>As the programme scaled quickly, predictable system gaps appeared:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design patterns drifting across pods</li>
      <li>Mobile design evolving separately from shared components</li>
      <li>Inconsistent handover to development</li>
      <li>Limited visibility of end-to-end journeys</li>
      <li>Design and product debt building quietly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We had GOV.UK Design System foundations — but One Login needed clearer structure to scale effectively.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="role">
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mapped real system gaps — not just surface design issues</li>
      <li>Used roadmap leverage points to introduce practical improvements</li>
      <li>Applied technical understanding to build trust across disciplines</li>
      <li>Strengthened design tools, processes and handover without slowing delivery</li>
      <li>Surfaced hidden debt as visible, manageable product gaps</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="approach">
    <h2>How I Navigated It</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>1. Making Complexity Visible — with an MVP Prototype</h3>
      <p><strong>The issue:</strong> Teams lacked a shared, reliable view of how journeys connected — especially as mobile, web and in-person work scaled.</p>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identified roadmap opportunities to introduce an interactive prototype</li>
        <li>Built realistic, clickable journeys across web and mobile — focusing on happy paths first</li>
        <li>Applied technical detail so the prototype reflected how the service actually behaved</li>
        <li>Positioned the prototype as a practical tool for teams — not just a design deliverable</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The result:</strong> Quickly adopted as a critical tool for onboarding, training, spotting gaps and service readiness checks.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>2. Strengthening Design Tools — Building Structure into Daily Work</h3>
      <p><strong>The issue:</strong> Figma use was inconsistent. Mobile design patterns weren’t connected to the wider system. Handover to development varied.</p>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ran discovery to map design system pain points across pods</li>
        <li>Introduced clear structure to Figma: file standards, naming, handover improvements</li>
        <li>Built a mobile design system aligned with frontend components</li>
        <li>Established a contribution model for shared libraries</li>
        <li>Surfaced remaining gaps as product debt, managed in the wider roadmap</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The result:</strong> More reliable design foundations — reducing drift, improving handover, supporting scale.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>3. Aligning Design and Development — Through Structured Collaboration</h3>
      <p><strong>The issue:</strong> Design-to-development alignment was inconsistent, with gaps often hidden as delivery scaled.</p>
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Partnered with tech and QA leads to embed alignment into delivery</li>
        <li>Introduced visual snapshot tests to catch inconsistencies early</li>
        <li>Revisited shared component use across teams to reduce drift</li>
        <li>Used roadmap milestones to coordinate improvements</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The result:</strong> Fewer inconsistencies, improved shared understanding, alignment built into delivery — not bolted on.</p>

          <li>Limited visibility of service journeys</li>

  <section class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>Scaling a complex service isn’t about adding process. It’s about understanding system gaps, using the right moments to introduce structure, and building alignment through delivery.</p>
    <p>Making complexity visible, strengthening tools and surfacing product debt has helped One Login scale with more confidence — supporting teams and ensuring the service stays accessible and consistent for users.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="outcome">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Service journeys visible and accessible</li>
      <li>Design tools and mobile patterns aligned</li>
      <li>Design drift reduced, handover improved</li>
      <li>System gaps managed as visible product debt</li>
      <li>Teams more confident in delivery and readiness</li>
